This repository contains my solutions to leetcode and other coding problems I solved during interview prep and to review datastructures and algorithms. The problems are mainly solved using Javascript.

## 01 - Leetcode

_01-LeetCode_ contains my solutions to the leetcode problems from the popular website [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/). 

As a basis for which problems to solve first I'm using the __Blind 75__ and __Grind 75__ lists of leetcode problems from [Tech Interview Handbook](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/) as well as [NeetCode](https://neetcode.io/practice)'s __NeetCode 150__ list.
